Mancala: A two-player mancala game. 
	Rules for Basic Mancala and User-Interface:
	1. Each user gets six cups and one mancala(M).
	   The cups and mandala will be formatted as shown below.
	   Each player's cups and mancala will be located at the
	   bottom of the board.
             	 |{ }{ }{ } M{} { }{ }{ }|   <-- opponent's side
	         |{ }{ }{ } M{} { }{ }{ }|   <-- current player's side
	           A  B  C       D  E  F
	2. At the start of the game, each cup has 4 marbles
                 |{4}{4}{4} M{} {4}{4}{4}|
                 |{4}{4}{4} M{} {4}{4}{4}| 
	           A  B  C       D  E  F
	3. Taking turns, each player inputs their cup of choice.
	   All the marbles in that cup will be distributed counter-clockwise into the
	   other cups and to the current player's mancala (one per cup).
	   -- If the last marble distributed ends up in the current player's mancala,
	      they get an extra play.
	   -- If the last marble distributed ends up in an empty cup located on the
	      current player's side, all marbles in the cup directly above as well as
	      the current cup will be placed in the player's mancala.
	    Example
                   |{3}{5}{1} M{6} {3}{6}{2}|
	           |{0}{4}{2} M{4} {3}{1}{8}| 
		     A  B  C        D  E  F
              [Player A] Cup of Choice: F
	      ----- Current Board -----
                   |{4}{6}{2} M{6}  {4}{7}{3}|
	           |{1}{5}{2} M{10} {3}{1}{0}| <-- player's side 
        4. The game ends when all six cups on either side of the board are empty. The
           player with remaining marbles in their cups at the end of a game automatically
	   places the marbles into their own mancala. The player with the most marbles in
	   their mancala is the winner of the game.
	
	- Player to player communication comes into play when one player makes a move,
          and therefore updates the game board.
